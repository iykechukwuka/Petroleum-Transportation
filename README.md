To analyze and visualize the petroleum transportation data from refineries, focusing on key performance indicators like net weight changes between origin and destination, transportation delays, and refinery contributions. 

Project Brief: Power BI Analysis of Petroleum Transport Data
Project Title:
Analysis of Petroleum Product Transportation Efficiency from Refineries using Power BI
Objective:
To analyze and visualize the petroleum transportation data from refineries, focusing on key performance indicators like net weight changes between origin and destination, transportation delays, and refinery contributions. This analysis aims to provide insights into the efficiency of the petroleum logistics chain, including net weight discrepancies and transport timeframes.
Data Description:
The dataset includes records of petroleum product transportation from refineries, specifically detailing:
•	Work Shift: Indicates the shift during which transportation occurred.
•	Type: The type of petroleum product being transported, such as VB and C5+.
•	Refinery: The refinery where the product originated.
•	Origin Departure Date: The date when the product departed from the origin.
•	Origin Net Weight: The weight of the petroleum product at the origin point.
•	Destination Arrival Date: The date when the product arrived at the destination.
•	Destination Net Weight: The weight of the petroleum product upon arrival at the destination.
Key Metrics:
1.	Weight Discrepancy Analysis:
o	Calculate and visualize the differences between the net weights at the origin and the destination.
o	Identify patterns in weight losses or gains during transportation.
2.	Transportation Time Analysis:
o	Calculate the number of days between departure and arrival dates.
o	Identify potential delays by comparing expected delivery dates to actual arrival dates.
3.	Refinery Performance:
o	Compare the performance of different refineries in terms of product quantity and delivery efficiency.
o	Filter the data by refinery (e.g., Tehran, Pars Petrochemical) to assess performance trends.
4.	Product-Specific Analysis:
o	Break down transportation performance by product type (VB, C5+), focusing on potential differences in efficiency.
Visualizations in Power BI:
1.	Weight Discrepancy Line Chart:
o	A line chart showing the trend of net weight discrepancies over time for each refinery and product type.
2.	Transport Duration Histogram:
o	A histogram displaying the distribution of transportation times (days) between the origin and destination for each refinery.
3.	Refinery Contribution Pie Chart:
o	A pie chart representing the proportion of petroleum products transported by each refinery.
4.	Shift-wise Performance Bar Chart:
o	A bar chart comparing the total net weights handled in day shifts for each refinery and product type.
Analytical Process:
1.	Data Loading: Load the dataset into Power BI.
2.	Data Cleaning: Ensure the dates are in a proper format and correct any discrepancies in data.
3.	Measure Creation:
o	Create measures to calculate weight differences between origin and destination.
o	Create a new column for transportation duration in days.
4.	Visualizations: Develop the visualizations listed above for interactive analysis.
Expected Insights:
•	Transportation Efficiency: Identify which refineries and product types exhibit the least weight loss and fastest transport times.
•	Operational Issues: Highlight any irregularities such as significant weight losses or unusually long delivery times.
•	Shift Impact: Assess whether the shift during which transportation occurs affects overall efficiency.
This project will help stakeholders understand logistical inefficiencies in petroleum transportation and potentially improve operational processes for future shipments.
